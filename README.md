# portfolio-template
This is a portfolio template to practice web design. In this project I will only be using CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

The portfolio has 4 sections, the Home, About, Projects and Contact and it's responsive. When the elements on the navbar are pressed the page automatically scrolls to the right section.
